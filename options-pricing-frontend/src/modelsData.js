        details: 'The Black-Scholes Model was created by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in 1973. It is a foundational tool for understanding options and their pricing. The mathematical formula for estimating the theoretical price of European-style options uses variables such as the stock price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility. The model has significantly influenced financial markets by providing a framework for option pricing and risk assessment.The model simplifies real-world complexities and assumes constant volatility.'

        title: 'Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) Calculator', isDone: false, id: 2, desc: 'Calculates expected return of a particular asset or investment',
        details: 'The Capital Asset Pricing Model calculates the expected return of an asset or investment according to its inherent risk level. It uses beta (β), which is a measure of the stock\'s or investment\'s sensitivity in relation to the overall market. CAPM establishes a relationship between an asset\'s expected return, its beta (β), and the risk-free rate of return. It suggests that the expected return of an asset is equal to the risk-free rate plus a risk premium determined by the asset\'s beta. The higher the beta(higher sensitvity relative to market), the higher the expected return. CAPM serves as a vital tool for investors to assess an investment\'s risk and reward and to determine appropriate asset allocation in portfolios.'

        details: 'Bonds are financial instruments representing debt obligations issued by governments, corporations, or other entities to raise capital. When an investor buys a bond, they lend money to the issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments (coupon) and the return of the bond face value at maturity. Bonds vary in terms of duration, interest rates, and risks.They are considered relatively safer investments compared to stocks due to their predictable income streams and capital preservation. Bonds play a crucial role in the global financial markets, serving as a means for both entities to raise funds and investors to generate income while managing risk.'
