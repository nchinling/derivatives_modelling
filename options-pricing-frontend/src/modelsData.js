        title: 'Black-Scholes Option Pricing Model', isDone: true, id: 1, desc: 'It uses the Black-Scholes model to determine the fair market price for stock options',
        details: 'The Black-Scholes Model was created by Fischer Black, Myron Scholes, and Robert Merton in 1973. It is a foundational tool for understanding options and their pricing. The mathematical formula for estimating the theoretical price of European-style options uses variables such as the stock price, strike price, time to expiration, risk-free interest rate, and volatility. The model has significantly influenced financial markets by providing a framework for option pricing and risk assessment.The model simplifies real-world complexities and assumes constant volatility.'

        title: 'Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) Calculator', isDone: true, id: 2, desc: 'Calculates expected return of a particular asset or investment',
        details: 'The Capital Asset Pricing Model calculates the expected return of an asset or investment according to its inherent risk level. It uses beta (β), which is a measure of the stock\'s or investment\'s sensitivity in relation to the overall market. CAPM establishes a relationship between an asset\'s expected return, its beta (β), and the risk-free rate of return. It suggests that the expected return of an asset is equal to the risk-free rate plus a risk premium determined by the asset\'s beta. The higher the beta(higher sensitvity relative to market), the higher the expected return. CAPM serves as a vital tool for investors to assess an investment\'s risk and reward and to determine appropriate asset allocation in portfolios.'

        title: 'Bond Price Calculator', isDone: true, id: 3, desc: 'Calculates the price of bonds issued by governments or companies',
        details: 'Bonds are financial instruments representing debt obligations issued by governments, corporations, or other entities to raise capital. When an investor buys a bond, they lend money to the issuer in exchange for periodic interest payments (coupon) and the return of the bond face value at maturity. Bonds vary in terms of duration, interest rates, and risks.They are considered relatively safer investments compared to stocks due to their predictable income streams and capital preservation. Bonds play a crucial role in the global financial markets, serving as a means for both entities to raise funds and investors to generate income while managing risk.'

        title: 'Intrinsic Value Calculator', isDone: true, id: 4, desc: 'Calculates the intrinsic value of a stock and margin of safety',
        details: 'The term intrinsic value is an umbrella term which describes the true worth of an asset (e.g. company stock). Benjamin Graham introduced the idea of intrinsic value in his book, Security Analysis (1934). Financial analysts use the intrinsic value to decide which stocks are good investment opportunities, such as Benjamin Graham\'s model of calculating intrinsic value.'

        title: 'Dividend Yield Calculator', isDone: true, id: 5, desc: 'Calculates the ratio of the annual dividends paid by a company over its current stock price. It provides the returns (%) obtained by investing in the stock.',
        details: 'The dividend is one of the two main sources of returns for investing in the stock market, the other being capital appreciation. In general, only mature companies and REITS pay dividends. This is because the number of profitable growth opportunities for them is limited. It will generate more value for the shareholders if they pay out their net income as dividends. On the other hand, growth companies might pay out minimal or even zero dividends as they can create more value by reinvesting the earnings back into the business. This calculator can also be used to calculate the returns from property investments.'
