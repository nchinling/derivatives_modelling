# Financial Calculator App

## Overview

This project is a web-based financial calculator application that provides users with the ability to perform various financial calculations, including Black-Scholes option pricing, CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model), bond pricing, intrinsic value calculation, and dividend yield calculation. The application is built using React for the frontend and Django for the backend.

## Features

### Financial Models

The application includes the following financial models:

- **Black-Scholes Option Pricing:**
  - Allows users to calculate call and put option prices based on inputs such as asset price, exercise price, time to expiry, risk-free interest rate, volatility, and dividend yield.

  - Provides the expected return on an investment based on risk-free interest rate, beta, and market return.

- **Bond Pricing:**
  - Enables users to calculate the price of a bond using inputs like face value, coupon rate, yield to maturity, and time to maturity.

- **Intrinsic Value Calculation:**
